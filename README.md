# AIM - Build and run simulations of a LINE FOLLOWING BOT via CAMERA INPUT using IMAGE PROCESSING.

ROS - Robot Operating System
Link to ROS Line Following Bot Via Image Processing Tutorial Series: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCiTDJays9rWQZwQDaIt7af65Yy_L-YR1

# This tutorial series covers the following: -

1. Introduction to ROS.
2. Setting up ROS.
3. ROS publisher and subscriber

4. ROS services
5. Robot control with keyboard
6. OpenCV2 for Image Processing (Basic HSV Thresholding image)

7. OpenCV2 with ROS
8. Object (Path) Detection
9. Applying PID to improve performance via ROS Reconfigurations
10. Running the simulations in Gazebo

I hope this excites you enough to stick with me for right till the end of the tutorial series and come out on the other side with well functioning Line following Robot project of your own in hand.

We will use OFFICIAL ROS DOCS for reference and fast understanding in super efficient manner with no wasted movements. For each tutorial, check out the links in description, go through the short official docs quickly and follow along the tutorial with pace!

Best wishes!
